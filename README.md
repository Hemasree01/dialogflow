# Dialogflow Chatbot

## GCP Agent Builder

#### step 1: Create an agent app using the agent builder

#### step 2: Customize the agent by adding a data store, tool and a playbook of instructions to follow.

#### step 3: Go to integrations tab and select the conversational messanger to deploy the agent.there we can find the code to deploy this agent in a website. copy the code and use it in your code to get the chatbot in your website.(In my requirement I am using conversational messanger but there are other resources too you can use which ever is suitable. )

#### step 4: I developt a webpage using streamlit python (app.py) and added the conversational messanger to the code and deployed it in streamlit.
